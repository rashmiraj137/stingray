How to get involved
*******************

We encourage you to get involved with Stingray in any way you can!
First, read through the `README <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
Then, fork the `stingray <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_ and `notebooks <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks>`_ repositories (if you need a primer on GitHub and git version control, `look here <https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/git-tutorials-beginners/>`_) and work your way through the Jupyter notebook tutorials for the main modules.
Once you've familiarized yourself with the basics of Stingray, go to the `Stingray issues page <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_ and try to tackle one!
Other ways to get involved are outlined on the `project ideas <http://timelabtechnologies.com/ideas.html>`_ page, along with some astrophysical background/motivation.
Finally, you can read `these slides <https://speakerdeck.com/abigailstev/stingray-pyastro16>`_ from an early talk on
Stingray at the Python in Astronomy 2016 conference.

For organizing and coordinating the software development, we have a Slack group and a mailing list -- please use `this link <https://stingray-slack.herokuapp.com>`_ for Slack or send `one of us <https://github.com/orgs/StingraySoftware/people>`_ an email to join.
